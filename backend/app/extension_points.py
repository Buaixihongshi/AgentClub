"""The few places where optional extensions attach to the core.

Core modules call these hooks and never import ``backend.app.extensions``. The
composition roots install the extensions: ``main.py`` for the web app, and the
MCP subprocess through ``load()`` with the module names its parent passes down.
With nothing installed every hook is a no-op and Unity runs as the bare core.

Each hook is a list of callbacks, run in installation order. ``first`` returns
the first non-None result (a takeover), ``any`` is true when one callback says
so, ``collect`` gathers every truthy result, ``each`` runs them all for their
side effects.
