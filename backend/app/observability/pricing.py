"""Turn cost: provider-reported dollars when we have them, an estimate otherwise.

The provider reports `usage` on every turn (tokens, and sometimes a dollar
figure). Tokens are the durable fact; dollars are a view. This module keeps
that split: the price table lives here, and a cost is computed at read time, so
fixing a rate silently corrects every historical turn instead of leaving old
numbers in the database.

The estimate is deliberately rough and labelled "estimate" wherever it is
shown. A provider that reports `total_cost_usd` always wins over it.
